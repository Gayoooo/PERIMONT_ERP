      Each pair is a requirement contributing to this criterion, and the
      candidate that provides the requirement.
    * `incompatibilities` is a collection of all known not-to-work candidates
      to exclude from consideration.
    * `candidates` is a collection containing all possible candidates deducted
      from the union of contributing requirements and known incompatibilities.

      raised `RequirementsConflicted` (in which case it is always empty).
